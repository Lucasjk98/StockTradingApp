# Bootcamp Project 4

###### Lucas Jimenez

## Technologies used
-Python
-Django

## Project Overview
This is the 4th project of the University of Santa Barbara bootcamp, where I have developed a stock trading practice application using Django. The app allows users to practice trading by placing buy and sell orders for any stock, view their portfolio and cash balance, track the values of their holdings, and see a comprehensive transaction history.

## User Stories
- Stock Trading

As an aspiring trader, I want to practice buying and selling stocks. The app should allow me to search for stocks, view current prices, and execute buy or sell orders. It should update my portfolio and cash balance in real-time post-transaction.

- Portfolio Management

As a user, I need to view my portfolio to track my holdings. The app should display my current stock positions, the respective values, and historical performance. It's essential to have a clear view of my investment strategies' success.
  
- Transaction History

To keep track of my trading decisions, I require access to a detailed transaction history. This includes all buy and sell orders, with dates, quantities, and prices. This feature is crucial for analyzing my trading patterns and learning from them.  

## Ideas for Future Improvement
- Developing a mobile-responsive design for convenient on-the-go trading.
- Registration & Login and capability for more users
- Stock watchlist
- More aesthetic design with CSS
